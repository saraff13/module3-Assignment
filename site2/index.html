			The story of Henny Penny, also called Chicken Little, or sometimes Chicken-licken (not to be confused with “Finger-licken” from Kentucky Fried Chicken), the terrified little chicken convinced that the sky is falling and that life as we, or at least as chickens know it, is over, is common throughout European folklore—so common that “the sky is falling!” and “Chicken Little” and related names have become bywords for fearmongering, and the often tragic results that occur.
            Exactly where the first version of the story was told is a bit unclear, but one of the first to record the tale was Just Mathias Thiele (1795–1874), a Danish scholar employed at the Royal Danish Library. Inspired by Jacob and William Grimm, he began collecting Danish folktales, publishing his first collection in 1818. The collections proved to be so influential that Hans Christian Anderson would later dedicate a story to Thiele’s daughter. His version of Henny Penny appeared in his 1823 collection, with the familiar elements already present: rhyming names, a series of barn animals, a terror set off by something completely ordinary (in this case, a falling nut) and a very hungry fox more than willing to take advantage of the situation.

			The cow is, in fact, one of the most abundant and successful species on earth. At Bungehurst Farm in East Sussex, Kate learns about the biology of the modern day cow from Brenda Wear who manages the farms’ livestock.
            To better understand the history of cattle breeding, which have been farmed in the UK for over 6000 years, we meet Mark Cleverdon, a commentator on Livestock at The South of England Agricultural Society. Mark tells Kate about the history of breeding the perfect cow and why long horn cows were bred to develop the more common short horn cow.
            The United States is the top beef producing country supplying almost one-fifth of the world’s supply but in recent times, South America has become one of the world’s biggest beef exporters. Argentina is the major player having already farmed an estimated 52 million head of cattle in 2016.
            Zay Harding heads to the plains of Patagonia to discover the life of the gauchos, the semi-nomadic horsemen and cowhands of the Argentinian grasslands. It was the Spanish who introduced the cow to the Americas but Hannah Velton explains its journey further north to the United States. Over in the heart of Oklahoma, Justin Shapiro discovers the legacy of the Wild West left behind by the American cattle cowboys.

			Sushi

			Everything you never knew about sushi—its surprising origins, the colorful lives of its chefs, the bizarre behavior of the creatures that compose it—is revealed in this entertaining documentary account by Trevor Corson, the author of the highly acclaimed The Secret Life of Lobsters.
			In this richly reported story, Corson shadows several American sushi novices and a master Japanese chef, taking the reader behind the scenes as the students strive to master the elusive art of cooking without cooking. With the same eye for drama and humor that Corson brings to the exploits of the chefs, he delves into the biology and natural history of the creatures of the sea.
            He illuminates sushi's beginnings as an Indo-Chinese meal akin to cheese, describes its reinvention in bustling 19th-century Tokyo as a cheap fast food, and tells the story of the pioneers who brought it to America. He shows this unlikely meal now exploding into the American heartland just as the long-term future of sushi may be unraveling.
            The Story of Sushi is a compelling tale of human determination as well as a delectable smorgasbord of surprising food science, intrepid reporting, and provocative cultural history.
            The Story of Sushi is published by HarperCollins.
